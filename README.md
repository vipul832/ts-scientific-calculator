## **What is typescript**
- TypeScript is a free and open source high-level programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. 

## **Installation and StepUp**
  - To install Typescript in local system Follow the Step given Below:
    - **Step 1:** First we have to install Node js [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download). if you have alread have then skip Step 1.
    - **Step 2:** Use Command ```  npm install typescript@latest -g  ``` this command install the typescript compiler to check version of it use command ``` tsc -v```.
    - **Step 3:** Now you have to setup a config file of Typescript for that use command ``` tsc --init``` this command create config file and then later on you can set as per your requirement.
    - **Step 4:** To compile you Typescript file use command ``` tsc filename ```. Make sure are in same directory other wise to add path of file.
  
## Feature

- ### Memory Storage
  - You can store value and then do operation on it and Recall. 
    - MS button use for store value in local storage.
    - M+ and M- use to add value and subtract on local storage value.
    - MR Memory recall.
    - MC After you use is done you can clear you local storage.
    
- ### Trigonometry Operation
  - To find value of **sin,con,tan** and many more.
  - To use Inverse click on **"2nd"** button and for hyperbolic function click **"hyp"** button.
  - If you want ous sinh inverse first click on 2nd button and then click on **"hyp"** button so you will get.
  - For Unit change just click on **"DEG"** it and set as per you requirement.
  - You Minght get confuse in sin invers and sin h inverse display on screen.
      - **"sinin" = "sin^-1"**
      - **"sinhin" = "sinh^-1"**
  ### Flow of Trigonometry:
  - First click button then type the degree/radian/grad value and then click **"="** button.
  

- ### Function 
  -  **Note: All the functionality of Function are On Click event**
  - |x| use for modulus of value.
  - ⎣x⎦ find floor value example: 2.3 it will give 2
  - ⎡x⎤ find ceil value example: 2.3  it will give 3
  - rand if your input is empty it will generate random number between 0,1 and else if you input number it will go in that range.
  - dms this function convert degree to degree: minutes:second.
  - deg will convert you input into degrees
  
 - ###  Way to use some Operation
   - In **Cube root , square root and factorial** are the on click function for that you have to give number and then click on those button.
   - In **"x^3" and "x^2"**  you have first type the number and then click on operation button but you will see there is no answer on screen hmmm wait just click on "=" button and there you go you will get you answer.
   
      - **step:1** Enter the number.
      - **step:2** Click on "square root " / "cube root" / "x^2/ "x^3".
      - **step:3** Then Click on "=" for answer.
    
   - For **"10^x","1/x","2^x","e^x"** here you have to first click on button and then enter the number. For answer click on "=" button.
   
   - In **"logyx"** you have pass the base and then click on "logyx" and then enter value don't forget to click on "=" for answer. Similar in "y root x" button.
   
   
   - Now for last arithmetic function use can use bracket,"e" and "pi" in side the expression it will solve the expression just remember to click "=" for answer.
